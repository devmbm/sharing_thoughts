Long positions
- have thesis, buy more as it is confirmed _even if the price is higher, the risk/reward may be more attractive_
- an event (new info) may change thesis, removes downside, and is an opportunity to add

Short positions
- know the timing = downside may be all priced at one point
- 180 principle `see: @dasan` or inverted short, when there is only 1 outcome to continue falling (bankruptcy) and all other outcomes, may shoot the price a lot. _"you may want to go long your own short"_

> And there's usually a point where the short has been working, right? And people think that we're going to work and it continued to go down. And that's actually the exact point where the growth part of the business is becoming a material enough part of the business to move the top line in aggregate. [...] Whenever people are making really strong, absolute, permanent left or right tail statements, that's an indicator that work should be done [...] ends up in situations where people are really heavily short something where even a light breeze can send a stock up 50 or a 100 percent.

Best bets = you can add when you're right

> the best bets are things where you can be really, really small until you know you're right, or have no position until you know you're right. And you can put a big position on once you know you're right

Low multiples = arbitrage but not long-term 

> people are frustrated with, "Why is this valuation multiple low?" They're not thinking through it like a game that's played multiple times. And so the issue is, yes you might be right on the next three months, six months, twelve months, but does anything the company... can the company do anything in the next year that can validly change the bear case for the terminal value of this business?

Never simplify "mr. market is irrational", know shareholder base

> You can't just say Mr market's drunk and depressed right now or something. I need to understand why are people not owning the security? 

> what I'm really focused on is being high context as an investor. I want to understand who else has invested in this in the past. Who else invested in now? Why? Who shorted? Et cetera. I want to understand who else is at the poker table, as much as I want to understand the cards. Because I really want to have a really good understanding of what those people's constraints are. And most people, if you're friendly and reasonable and you're collaborative are happy to be like, _"Look, I agree with the thesis. I can't own any more for XYZ reasons."_ 


Constrain arbitrage = clever investors may not be allowed to touch something (either permanently or temporary)

> And what I want to understand is what other people's constraints are and incentives are and how those things work. And then you can process information from that perspective. And when you figure out a constraint is about to be added or removed,

Inverted shorts

> And a lot often the shorts had been successful, the shorts were right. We buy a lot of things where we find people who are very short them, who are now it's like, "We're not short anymore." You know, it played out, it's good, but they're not long. And then we figure out, "Okay, is it actually a long thesis that one?" The issue is people are still optimizing to, "I can't own that because a year ago there were really smart funds out, pitching it short, and they made a lot of money."

and why large investors avoid them (opportunity)

> And so if you go pitch a name and they go pull up their notes and they have somebody who pitched it short the way the allocator interprets it is, "I'm now going to compare Brandon and Dan and whose notes are better." And there's not a really elegant way to always make the point that both are right, that thesis was right last year, this long thesis right this year. And people don't have the mental bandwidth, the allocator doesn't have the mental bandwidth if they're doing 10 calls a day with managers to make those nuanced points. And so they out of risk aversion are going to exert pressure on money managers which creates these circumstances.

###### Takeaways

- __longs:__ average up, new info may remove downside = R/R improves
- __shorts:__ need to be timed very well
	- an __inverted short__ is when often makes sense to go long _after short has worked very well, there is a tail of outcomes that shoot stock up_
	- clever investors may not invest due to career risk of being associated with stock after a short, but often BOTH short was good thesis, and long can be a good one (short became obsolete)
- __best ideas:__ those you can research and add when you know you're right, not take lot of risk
- __market is full of smart people:__ understand why they're buying/selling the stock, what is the constrain, the edge is in the context since information is available to all
	- the __constrain is the mandate__ of large investors (weights, career risk,) and you MUST understand the constraints _permanent or temporary constraints, removal of ownership constraints can cause delayed buying into stock_
	- mandate arbitrage (ex: short what will be un-investable, and opposite)
- Theme of __2020s = there is no information edge__
	- edge may be exploiting other constraints
	- extroverts outperform, you need to talk to a lot of people of different backgrounds _"no fundamental work on Bloomberg only can outperform"_ to get context information (vs raw info)
	- network of investors with insights very valuable
	- asymmetric warfare = group of people exploit a blind spot, and brainstorm ideas very fast (instant messaging)
- __"if you believe world has gotten better, expect incremental value from trivial things"__
	- generation is "softer" due to no war, no hard labour...
	- signal looks more like noise (if signal is trivial)
	- adults tend to underestimate success from small improvements on tech `ex: Instagram success over other social media` or intangible items `ex: NFTs, cryptokitties, skins on videogames` 
	- many of the things may not be for you `ex: thinking Peloton is just "a bike with an iPad" (but many others failed)`
- __"be curious, not judgmental"__
	- "what is it from their perspective?"
	- niche is getting popular `ex: Anime boom`
	- micro-communities very powerful = since you can micro-target, an emerging brand/product can come out of nowhere
- concept: to play the __"metagame"__, you need a __community = network of people__ to brainstorm ideas
	- \>1 person can monitor market/developments, share ideas
	- work-life balance = use other's work `ex: Twitter` to save time 
	- digital tools = allow having multiple groups of contacts (a network) more than physically possible in real life
	- network gives back in return MUCH MORE you gave (no zero-sum), even introducing 2 smart people to each other can be life-changing
	- __\= compounding human capital__ _"not build to extract info, build an ecosystem by connecting people"_
	- anti-social mentality (never sharing) doomed if competing against a network of smart people
	- only downside of making enemies + sustained conflict w/ others (also: the network can back you if you're being attacked by someone else)
- You will miss many ideas _"you're not going to catch them all, this is not Pokémon"_ = no individual investment is worth compromising your process + you only need 2-4 good ideas per year for incredible returns
- Interested in businesses at market multiples _"there is no average business"_
	- ideal: core business FCF + __emerging part not meaningful/priced yet__ (incremental part seems silly) but is solving a B2B problem or affecting consumer behavior in B2C
	- emerging part...
		- is it transitory or can sustain demand and grow?
		- is the company culture prepared to be transformed?
		- are people associated with product and not competitor?
		- are users selling/advocating for product? community effect `ex: Shopify sellers engaging with each other after positive experience (a user for life)` + having a community adds trust to incremental users
		- is the product sticky? can happen in either B2B or B2C
		- try to predict WHAT you'd expect if transitory and cannot be sustained
	- returns must not be only in tail, rather base position has good R/R and tail option is call option embedded in stock + average up if tail outcomes become more likely
	- if emerging does not fade away = terminal value is guaranteed above consensus + predict % of TAM is not unreasonable, how its economics could be at larger scale `ex: MTCH-Tinder` (market not pricing a compounder inside an "average" company)
- aim for absolute returns, repeated yearly, _"not a competition on best research"_, own compounders AND not blow up - keep within the circle of competence and take "easy bets"
- NOT invest in companies where CEO/management do not understand the market opportunity they should be addressing (and are not focused on it) `however you may not understand the business is doing (ex: Naked Wines was addressing market of loyal customers difficult to target digitally) or incentives of management not aligned with yours`
- You need __passion__ to understand your circle of competence _"focus on companies that get you exciting"_, careful not to bring biases `ex: value investors wanting hard assets from great depression bias` = by optimizing one risk such as high valuation you could take other risks you are not accounting `ex: regulatory, management, disruption...` (wait until opportunity arrives, perhaps 1-2 times per year)
- investment mistakes often are not stockpicking issues, rather wrong decisions taken `due to pressure, personal issues distracting, focus elsewhere... often all come at same time`, focus on HOW you will you manage when it happens `since it often affects people who have not handled a loss ever, and are not trained on how to handle` = your system MUST be robust to handle self-sabotage (personal issues spill into investing) + be more empathetic and helpful with everyone, everyone struggles with something
- re: \#Neversell = you cannot rely on 1 single stock, ten good investments outweigh one (and you will not die from a single bad investment)
- Time reading 10-Ks COULD be wasted if learning about meaningless industries/companies `that apply to very narrow industry + no meaningful takeaways, investment thesis is just speculation` = do research when knowledge is meaningful towards other ideas
- If you have a database of ideas and frameworks + network of people = you can accelerate research, very useful to accelerate future research + have a framework to discard ideas in short-time `ex: impossible claims such as in biotech large breakthroughs with a single device, sell-side analysts repeating unrealistic claims or guidance, poorly presented ideas, difficult to prove thesis with incremental information, "a microcap who hasn't done a good product in last 25 years"...`
- Understand the industry + sub-industries, often thesis are written without context `ex: random thesis on Seeking Alpha` and industry context makes the thesis be wrong by ignoring relevant caveats, either long or short ideas may be structurally wrong from missing an insight very relevant to its sector (why you want to have a deep insight of an industry, \>30years worth of developments, at least large- and mid-caps)
