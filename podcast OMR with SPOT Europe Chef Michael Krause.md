#### Takeaways

- [[SPOT]] is moving from music to audio platform
- SPOT Europe is divided into 5 hubs: `to be confirmed`
	- Russia and CIS
	- Northern
	- UK/IR
	- France + Benelux
	- South Europe

__Europe podcasts__

- Germany is more advanced + UK as it benefits from USA content + Sweden
- #Monetization of Europe lags Europe, listeners not used to ad frequency - so far solid progress
- [[Anchor]] acquisition globally available, unlike Studios acquired in USA
- Newer trends: horoscope, younger oriented podcasts, short format and high frequency (daily updates)
- Other wins: last of "Rundfunkanstalten", create podcasts with SZ, other local content
- Spotify Originals can fill the gaps, add diversity
- "wir investieren schon ordentlich"

Numbers:

- 165m subscribers, 40% in Europe
- 34% of all users in Europe
`ARD is cited as SPOT podcast market share being 30-50%`
- "there is still room for growth"

Global strategy:

- Be a global player, but a local player at the same time
- Top streams tend to be more local than it is speculated

__Podcasting / non-Music__

- Context:
	- lot of daily/high frequency podcasts in 3-10 minutes
	- lack of conferences from #COVID 
	- closing gap between creators and listeners
- Very early format for creators
- Feedback is immediate, unlike podcasts/music. Currently there is feedback via Twitter, but not directly with the app.
- Challenging for creator to gather listeners, host and invited, and create spontaneously.
- Idea: music artists to connect with fans in a release `example: how could would it be if you had an [album] release and you say all fans: "please come at midnight and tell me how did you like it, I will explain a little bit about the album as well"`

__Podcast creator strategy__

- offer "Open Access", SPOT wants all audio to be available on the platform even if creator chooses to #monetize with own means
- If not, SPOT to allow creator payments with limited take-rate
- Idea: 1bn users and 1m creators to live from it
- For SPOT the #economics are not paying the labels for each listen
- Perfect formula: engaging content, reward older listner base and attract new one

__Music__

- #ads do not work as well, it is more difficult to convince someone to listed what it's not attracted to, you cannot compensate that with ads
- SPOT to use platform with better targeting to exploit areas where it could work (Marketplace tool)
- "Discovery Mode" as other type of mmarketing


__Partnerships__

- [[TikTok]] cooperation with a "organic channel", to offer Spotify sibs.
- [[NFLX]] cooperation on podcasts
- Most of marketing is pay-per-download


__AAPL store fees__

- SPOT (and others) suing __AAPL__ in the European Union about Google Play fees for payments and transactions
